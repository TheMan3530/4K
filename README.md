# Friday Night 4K

So this is the source code for Friday Night 4K, AKA Friday Night Trollin' because the game's font can't handle numbers. Yay.

I guess you can make mods built off of this, I don't know why you would, but you can.

This game was based off of a troll server on Discord I made.

## Build instructions

THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR COMPILING THE GAME'S SOURCE CODE!!!

NinjaMuffin explained it pretty well so here's a link to where he explains how to build it.

### Story summary

As you can see, there is no dialogue or cutscenes in this game. This will be added in a future update, but for now there is none.

Because of this, here is a summary of the lore.

So one day Bf and Gf started looking up hentai and daddy dearest saw them so he sent them into my discord server and boom Friday Night 4K.

More weeks will be added soon.

Yay.

beware the man in the "bruh" difficulty.
